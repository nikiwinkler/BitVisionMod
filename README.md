# BitVisionMod

A live bitcoin ticker to show the best time to sell/buy using data from openAI. I personally use this and was able to make around 34.5% profit from the last BTC drop that happend shortly before the halving and the unstable price the hours after.


Currently able to:
Show a daily exchange rate graph
Real-time monitoring of Bitcoin-related news, technical indicators, and blockchain network data

++ Added pre-build ++
